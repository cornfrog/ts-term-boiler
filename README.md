# Boilerplate for Typescript Terminal Programs
---
### Description:
This is the boilerplate code that I use to get started when making Typescript terminal programs.

### Requirements:
1. Node Version 21.7.1
2. Typescript 5.4.2
3. Yarn Package Manager

### Installation:
1. To install run the following git command: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cornfrog/ts-term-boiler
```
2. To confirm everything is set up correctly run the script ```yarn start``` and you should see the following output in  your terminal: 
```
yarn start
yarn run v1.22.22
$ yarn clean && yarn build && node .
$ rm -rf build
$ tsc
All set! Edit ./src/main.ts to get started.
```

### Post-Install:
Once installed make sure to remove the ```.git``` to start your own repo, and change the ```package.json```, ```.gitignore``` and ```tsconfig.json``` files to better fit your project!
